excerpt: "Chatbots are used for the facilitation of human agents by decreasing their involvement in manually done tasks. This Chatbot is developed for students of discrete mathematics. The dataset for this experiment is accumulated from 3 books of discrete mathematics. Our model is a variant of transformer known as Bert-base-NLI-mean-tokens. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). SBERT library is used for the generation of queryresponse embeddings. This model is fine-tuned according to our dataset and provided this model to students with android based mobile App. This model results in increase in the knowledge of students. The same approach will be implemented for other subjects as well."

Hand tracking and gesture recognition are rapidly developing fields with many applications in
human-computer interface (HCI). This technology enables computers to recognize and respond to
hand movements and gestures, creating a more natural and intuitive interface. With the increasing
popularity of augmented reality and virtual reality devices, the demand for advanced hand tracking
and gesture recognition technologies is growing. The purpose of this research is to study the current state of the art in hand tracking and gesture recognition and to develop new and improved
techniques for HCI applications with ‘You only look once’ models that result in the improvement
of the user’s immersive feeling in the virtual world. The research results will be used in a virtual electrical power lab along with the learning management system. To evaluate the implementation, the surveys will be administered before and after the classes. The research will contribute to advancing the technologies by developing new and improved hand tracking and gesture recognition algorithms and integrating them into HCI applications.
