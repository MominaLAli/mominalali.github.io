# About Me


I'm **Momina L. Ali**, passionate about leveraging **data science, artificial intelligence, and immersive technologies** to advance innovation in **engineering education** and **human-centered computing applications**.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computational methods** and **educational innovation**, where I strive to design intelligent, data-driven systems that improve how people learn, make decisions, and engage with technology.  

I focus on applying **machine learning** and **immersive technologies** (VR/AR) to explore complex problems and create practical tools that transform both **STEM education** and **healthcare training environments**. From adaptive learning platforms to virtual laboratories, my portfolio highlights projects that enhance user experiences and support evidence-based decision-making.  

A key highlight of my work includes the development of a **virtual reality application** that allows students to interact with digital lab devices through intuitive **hand gestures**, fostering **natural, immersive learning experiences** in engineering education. This reflects my broader vision: to design technologies that are seamless, responsive, and aligned with how humans learn and problem-solve.
