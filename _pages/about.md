# About Me

Welcome! I'm **Momina L. Ali**, passionate about developing intelligent, data-driven solutions that advance innovation in **medical imaging** and **virtual reality applications**.  

My interests lie at the intersection of computational methods and human-centered design, where I strive to tackle critical challenges in modern healthcare and education through advanced computing techniques.

I focus on applying immersive technologies and machine learning to explore complex problems and create practical tools that make a difference.  
From diagnostic imaging to virtual training environments, my portfolio highlights projects aimed at improving healthcare outcomes and enhancing user experiences in medical and educational settings.

A key highlight of my work includes the development of a **virtual reality application** that enables users to interact with digital lab devices using intuitive **hand gestures**, creating more **natural and immersive experiences** for education and simulation.  
This reflects my broader vision — to design technologies that feel seamless, responsive, and human-centric.

## Current Interests

- **AI-enhanced diagnostic models** in medical imaging  
- **Augmented and virtual reality systems** for interactive learning and patient engagement  
- **Multimodal data integration** in clinical research contexts  

I take pride in producing work that is technically sound, thoughtfully designed, and aligned with user needs in clinical, academic, and industry settings.

## Beyond Tech

I’m deeply passionate about **collaboration**, **open science**, and **mentorship**.  
I actively seek opportunities to work with fellow researchers, healthcare professionals, and innovators to build solutions that matter.  
Whether it's co-developing a prototype, sharing knowledge, or brainstorming a new interdisciplinary project — I welcome meaningful engagement.
